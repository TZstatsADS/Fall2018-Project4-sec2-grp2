GOALS
AND
Let's
examlne
our
plans
and
goals
for
each
of
Che
major
lssues.
First,
natural
gas
deregulatlon.
The
chemlcal
consumes
over
two
cublc
feet
of
natural
gas
annually
15
more
than
10%
of
the
total
Unlted
States
and
about
25%
of
the
use.
1993
15
our
last
chance
for
to
be
enacted
to
replace
the
NGPA
before
partlal
decontrol
occurs
on
January
1935.
The
and
Congress
will
be
reluctant
to
address
natural
gas
1n
1934,
presldentlal
electlon
year.
Furthermore,
our
worst
case
15
no
longer
just
"no
actlon";
15
an
extended
NGFA.
Our
baslc
on
deregulatlon
15
that
she
NGPA
be
amended
to
provlde
for:
Smooch
and
phase
up
of
all
natural
gas
wellhead
Ceiling
prices
to
market
levels.
Free
market
access
for
all
consumers,
pipellnes,
and
to
all
types
of
natural
gas
removal
of
and
demand
Includmg
the
repeal
of
the
sectlons
of
the
Fuel
Use
Act
and
1ncremental
In
order
to
make
Significant
progress
over
the
1n
the
deregulatlon
debate,
He
must
address
1n
detall
four
areas
of
controversy.
F1rst...the
timing
of
"old"
gas
decontrol.
The
1nterstate
pipellnes,
companles,
and
some
1nterstate
consumers
are
reluctant
to
give
up
natural
gas
access
and
advantages
that
they
have
under
the
NGFA.
Many
are
decontrol
old
gas,
but
not
new
gas.
Second...1s
the
problem
of
producer/plpellne
contracts.
The
1nterstate
pipelines
are
qulte
concerned
about
Imprudent
contracts
that
they
have
Signed,
after
the
NGPA
was
enacted,
that
contaln
price
escalator
clauses.
In
theory
these
clauses,
upon
decontrol,
would
Increase
the
price
of
gas
paid
these
pipelines
beyond
market
levels.
The
pipelines
want
protectlon
to
prevent
Th1rd...1s
tax.
