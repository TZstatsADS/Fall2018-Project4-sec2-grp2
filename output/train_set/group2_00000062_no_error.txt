conducted

reform,

honor

Mr.

of
the
Board
of

appeared
on
behalf
of
the
Assoclatlon.
Our
before
both
was
devoted
to
two
areas

namely,
capltal
formatlon
and
taxatlon
of
forelgn
source
1ncome.
1n
the
capltal
formatlon
area
we
recommended
the
adoptlon
of
such
tax
1ncent1ves
as
the
ma
1nvestment
tax
credlt
pemanent,
the
corporate
1ncome
tax
rate,
and
cost
recovery
allowances.
We
contended
these
actlons
are
needed
to
35515:
to
generate
funds
1nternally
to
meet
capltal
requlrements.
1n
the
forelgn
area
we
recommended
that
no
change
be
made
1n
the
forelgn
tax
credlt
and
none
respect
to
the
timing
of
the
